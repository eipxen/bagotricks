'''
    A module for finding the smallest subset of a list of integers 
    which adds to zero

    As this problem, the subset sum problem, is NP-complete in general,
    don't expect this to work too well!  The run time of this algorithm
    is O(n^), where k is the number of elements (the size) of the
    smallest subset of the given list of integers that sums to zero
